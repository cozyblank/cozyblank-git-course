## What is Git?

`Git` is the most popular `Version Control System`

`Version Control System` records the changes made to our code over time. This special database is called `Repository`. We can look at our project history and see who has made what change and why. We can easily revert back to our earlier stage.

Without this version control system, you have to constantly and manually store entire projects in various folders. This is very slow and doesn't scale at all, especially if multiple people have to work on the same project. You'll have to constantly toss around the latest code via email or some other mechanisms. Then, manually merge the change.

In a nutshell, with the version control system, we can track history and work together. 

`Version Control System` falls into two categories: centralized and distributed.

In centralized system, all team members connect to a central server and get the latest copy of the code to share the change of the code.  Subversion and Microsoft Team Foundation server are an example of the centralized version control system. The problem of this centralized architecture is the single point of failure. If the server goes to off-line,  you cannot collaborate or save snapshot of our project. So we have to wait until the server comes back alright.

In distributed system, we don't have to worry about this problem. Every team member has a copy of the project with its history on their machine. So we can save our snapshot of our project locally on our machine.

If the central server is off-line, we can synchronize our work directly with others. Git and Mercurial are an example of the distributed version control system.

Out of all this, git is the most popular version control system because it is

- free
- open source
- super fast
- scalable
- cheap branching / merging 

### Key Points

1. Track History
2. Work Together



## Using GIT

- The Command Line
- Code Editors & IDEs (GitLens)
- Graphical User Interfaces (GUI Clients)
- GitKraken Git GUI 
- SourceTree 

### Why Command Line

- GUI tools have limitations
- GUI tools are not always available

## Configuring Git

```linux
git config --global user.name "jos50275266"
git config --global user.email jos50275266@gmail.com

// default editor - I'm going to use Visual Studio Code in this course
// --wait flag tells the terminal window to wait until we close the new VSCode Instance
git config --global core.editor "code --wait"

// Default Editor
git config --global -e 

git config --global core.autocrlf inp

```

On the window, the end of the line are marked with two special characters. On Mac the end of the line are indicated with line feed. If we don't handle this different special character on the end of the line, it will run into an issue. 

When a windows user wants to check his repo,  it will get you to remove the CR character from the end of the line. Similar, when we check out his code from the repo, it will get you to add LF character at the end of the line. To achieve this behavior, we should set this attribute as true.

On the other hand, when a macOS user checks out the repo, she doesn't want to get CR character from the Repo. If an carriage returns, it will

```linux
git config --global core.autocrlf true // window
git config --global core.autocrlf input // macOS
```
